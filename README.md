# Object Detection with Speech Notification (YOLOv3 + gTTS)

This project is a real-time object detection system built using the **YOLOv3** deep learning model and **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)**. It captures video from your webcam, detects known objects, and audibly announces the names of detected objects using text-to-speech technology.

# Features

-  Real-time object detection using a webcam
-  Powered by YOLOv3 trained on 80 COCO classes (e.g., person, car, dog)
-  Speaks out names of detected objects using gTTS
-  Supports detection from both live video and static images
-  Automatically manages and deletes temporary audio files
-  Multi-threaded playback to avoid blocking the main detection loop
