# Object Detection with Speech Notification (YOLOv3 + gTTS)

This project is a real-time object detection system built using the **YOLOv3** deep learning model and **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)**. It captures video from your webcam, detects known objects, and audibly announces the names of detected objects using text-to-speech technology.

# Purpose

-   Demonstrate real-time object detection using deep learning
-   Integrate speech synthesis with computer vision for real-world interaction
-   Build an assistive tool that could help visually impaired individuals by describing their surroundings
-   Provide an educational example of how to combine multiple AI technologies (vision + audio)
-   Showcase the use of pre-trained models (YOLOv3) and cloud-based tools (gTTS) in Python projects
