# 🧠 Object Detection with Speech Notification (YOLOv3 + gTTS)

This project is a real-time object detection system built using the **YOLOv3** deep learning model and **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)**. It captures video from your webcam, detects known objects, and audibly announces the names of detected objects using text-to-speech technology.
